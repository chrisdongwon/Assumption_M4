On 28 March 2025 (Friday), we will have an in-class quiz. You can expect the quiz to contain five (5) problems, very similar to the following questions.

You are expected to show all work when applicable, and simplify your answers when applicable.

1. Write the mathematical definition of a rational number.
2. Simplify $$(\frac{\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}}{\frac{e}{f}})$$
3. Does $$(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2$$ for any numbers $$a,b$$? Why or why not? Explain.
4. Find the equation of a line connecting $$(a,b)$$ and $$(c,d)$$.
5. List all the elements of the set $$\{3k: k \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } k \leq 10\}$$
