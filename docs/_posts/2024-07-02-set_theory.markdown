When we first started learning mathematics, we generally dealt with specific numbers one at a time, and then we learned Algebra in which we used variables to represent various numbers, and the collection of variables in which they formed a specific description of many numbers in general, such as the integers and the rational numbers to say the least. Such collections are referred to as **sets**, and they can be collections of any objects of mathematical interest, not just numbers. We denote the collection with curly braces, i.e. $$\{...\}$$. A set with no elements is referred to as the empty set, denoted $$\{\}$$ or $$\emptyset$$. 

Then, what kind of _elements_ can we have in a set? Believe it or not, it doesn't always have to be numbers. Of course, a collection of numbers is of general interest in terms of mathematics, but sometimes, it can be even more. As an example, consider the following: $$S = \{\emptyset\}$$. This is a set of sets, where the only member in this set is the empty set. Weird, right? Since this set contains at least one element, it is considered to be not empty, even though the only element in this set is an empty set! To denote a membership in a set, we use the symbol $$\in$$. As a concrete usage, we can say that $$\emptyset \in S$$. Think $$\in$$ as "e" for "element of."
