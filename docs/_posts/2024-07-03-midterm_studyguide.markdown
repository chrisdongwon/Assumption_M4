1. Let $$S$$ be a nonempty set and let $$U = \mathcal{P}(S)$$, the powerset of $$S$$, and let $$A, B \in \mathcal{P}(S)$$. Recall that the powerset of $$S$$ is a set of all subsets of $$S$$, hence $$A$$ and $$B$$ are simply subsets of $$S$$. Using the set-builder notation, suggest a definition for the following operations:

    * The complement of $$A$$: $$A^{\prime}$$. 
    * The union of $$A$$ and $$B$$: $$A \cup B$$.
    * The intersection of $$A$$ and $$B$$: $$A \cap B$$.

1. Let $$U = \mathbb{Z}$$, A = $$\{x : 0 \leq x \leq 100 \text{ and } x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$, $$B = \{x : x \text { is divisible by } 2\}$$, and $$B = \{x : x \text { is not divisible by } 2\}$$.
