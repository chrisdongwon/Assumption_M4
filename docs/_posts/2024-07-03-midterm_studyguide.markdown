Answer the following as a review for your upcoming midterm exam. Make sure to show as much work as possible in order to maximize your points on the exam - any unsupported answers will warrant partial credit.

1. Let $$S$$ be a nonempty set and let $$U = \mathcal{P}(S)$$, the powerset of $$S$$, and let $$A, B \in \mathcal{P}(S)$$. Recall that the powerset of $$S$$ is a set of all subsets of $$S$$, hence $$A$$ and $$B$$ are simply subsets of $$S$$. Using the set-builder notation, suggest a definition for the following operations:

    * The complement of $$A$$: $$A^{\prime}$$. 
    * The union of $$A$$ and $$B$$: $$A \cup B$$.
    * The intersection of $$A$$ and $$B$$: $$A \cap B$$.

1. Let $$U = \mathbb{Z}$$, $$A = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} : 0 \leq x \leq 100\}$$, $$E = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \text { is divisible by } 2\}$$, and $$O = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \text { is not divisible by } 2\}$$.

    * Are $$E$$ and $$O$$ disjoint sets? Why or why not?
    * What is $$A \cap E$$?
    * What is $$A \cup O$$?
    * What is $$(A \cap E)^{\prime}$$?
    * What is the cardinality of $$A \cap E$$?
    * Is $$A \cup O$$ a proper subset of $$A$$? Why or why not?
    * Classify $$U,A,E,O$$ as either finite or infinite.

1. What is the definition of **set equality**? What is the definition of **set equivalence**? Are equal sets also equivalent? Are equivalent sets also equal? Explain.

1. What is the difference between a **Venn diagram** and an **Euler diagram**? Compare and contrast.

1. Write the general formula for the cardinality of a union of two sets, i.e. $$n(A \cup B)$$. What is the formula when $$A$$ and $$B$$ are disjoint? Hint: inclusion-exclusion principle.

1. True or false? $$ab = GCD(a,b) + LCM(a,b)$$. If false, what is the correct statement?

1. Describe the steps to the Euclidean Algorithm, and find $$GCD(194, 268)$$ using the algorithm.
