## Section 1.1: The Rational Numbers

1. Definition of **rational numbers**:

A number of the form $$\frac{n}{d}$$ where the following conditions **must** be satisfied:
- $$n$$ and $$d$$ are integers
- The denominator is not zero. Symbolically, $$d \not = 0$$
- $$\frac{n}{d}$$ is simplified. More specifically, we say that $$n$$ and $$d$$ have no factors in common (more on this in Chapter 3). 

2. $$2.4$$ is not an integer and $$1.2$$ is not an integer. Therefore, the condition that the numerator and the denominator must be integers is not satisfied, meaning $$\frac{2.4}{1.2}$$ is not a rational number by the definition. 

3. $$\frac{2}{4}$$ is not simplified - but it *can* be simplified to $$\frac{1}{2}$$. Therefore, $$\frac{1}{2}$$ is not a rational number by the definition. 

4. $$\frac{0}{0} = 1$$ if we simply follow the convention that the same numbers at the top and at the bottom yields $$1$$. In a similar sense, $$\frac{0}{0} = 0$$ if we only look at the numerator and see that it is $$0$$. Therefore, $$\frac{0}{0} = 1$$ and $$\frac{0}{0} = 0$$, but **no number is both 0 and 1**. $$\frac{0}{0}$$ is undefined for this reason. 

5.
- If we follow the formula in the text, we get:

$$\frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{7} = \frac{2 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 7} = \frac{29}{21}$$

- We do not always have to follow the formula *if you can identify a common denominator*. In this case, the common denominator is:

$$18 \cdot 4 = 24 \cdot 3 = 72$$

Therefore,

$$\frac{11}{18} - \frac{13}{24} = \frac{4}{4} \cdot \frac{11}{18} - \frac{13}{24} \cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{44 - 39}{72} = \frac{5}{72}$$

- $$\frac{ab}{cd} \cdot \frac{c}{b} = \frac{abc}{cdb} = \frac{a}{d}$$

Notice that $$b, c, d \not = 0$$ since the denominator cannot be $$0$$.

- $$\frac{a+b}{c+d} \div \frac{e-f}{g-h} = \frac{a+b}{c+d} \cdot \frac{g-h}{e-f} = \frac{(a+b)(g-h)}{(c+d)(e-f)}$$

Once again, notice that the denominators cannot be 0. Since $$c+d, e-f, g-h$$ all appear in the denominators of any present fractions, they also cannot be $$0$$.
