## Section 1.1: The Rational Numbers

1. Definition of **rational numbers**:
A number of the form $$\frac{n}{d}$$ where the following conditions **must** be satisfied:
- $$n$$ and $$d$$ are integers
- The denominator is not zero. Symbolically, $$d \not = 0$$
- $$\frac{n}{d}$$ is simplified. More specifically, we say that $$n$$ and $$d$$ have no factors in common (more on this in Chapter 3). 

2. $$2.4$$ is not an integer and $$1.2$$ is not an integer. Therefore, the condition that the numerator and the denominator must be integers is not satisfied, meaning $$\frac{2.4}{1.2}$$ is not a rational number by the definition. 

3. $$\frac{2}{4}$$ is not simplified - but it *can* be simplified to $$\frac{1}{2}$$. Therefore, $$\frac{1}{2}$$ is not a rational number by the definition. 

4. $$\frac{0}{0} = 1$$ if we simply follow the convention that the same numbers at the top and at the bottom yields $$1$$. In a similar sense, $$\frac{0}{0} = 0$$ if we only look at the numerator and see that it is $$0$$. Therefore, $$\frac{0}{0} = 0$$ and $$\frac{0}{0} = 0$$, but **no number is both 0 and 1**. $$\frac{0}{0}$$ is undefined for this reason.
