## Section 1.1: The Rational Numbers

1. Definition of **rational numbers**:
A number of the form $$\frac{n}{d}$$ where the following conditions **must** be satisfied:
- $$n$$ and $$d$$ are integers
- $$d \not = 0$$
- $$\frac{n}{d}$$ is simplified. More specifically, we say that $$n$$ and $$d$$ have no factors in common (more on this in Chapter 3).
