I hope you are doing well and staying safe.

Due to the recent earthquake, I have been notified that the class will be conducted in a hybrid format. 

Here is the information for our Google Meet conference room:

If, for some reason, you cannot make it to campus nor the online meeting, we will be working on Chapter 3 Section 1 in your summer booklet.
I will return the graded quizzes when everybody returns to campus.
