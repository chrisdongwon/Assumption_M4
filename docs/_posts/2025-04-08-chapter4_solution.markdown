## 4.1: Absolute Values

1.  By the definition of absolute values, we have that

    $$
    |2x+5| = 
    \begin{cases}
        2x+5 & \text{if } 2x+5 \geq 0 \\
        -(2x+5) & \text{if } 2x+5 < 0
    \end{cases}
    $$

    (Notice that I just replaced $$x$$ with $$2x+5$$ in the original definition)

    There are two cases to consider:
        - Suppose that $$2x+5 \geq 0$$. Then, $$|2x+5| = 2x+5 = 9$$. Solving for $$x$$ here yields $$x = 2$$.
        - Suppose that $$2x+5 < 0$$. Then, $$|2x+5| = -(2x+5) = -2x-5 = 9$$. Solving for $$x$$ here yields $$x = -7$$.
    Therefore, the solutions are $$x = 2$$ and $$x = -7$$. 

2.  In a similar sense, we get the following from the definition of absolute values:
    $$
    |x^2 - 4| = 
    \begin{cases}
        x^2 - 4 & \text{if } x^2 - 4 \geq 0 \\
        -(x^2 - 4) & \text{if } x^2 - 4 < 0
    \end{cases}
    $$

    So, let us consider the two cases again:
        - Suppose that $$x^2 - 4 \geq 0$$. Then, $$|x^2 - 4| = x^2 - 4 = 1$$. Solving for $$x$$ here yields $$x = \pm \sqrt{5}$$.
        - Suppose that $$x^2 - 4 < 0$$. Then, $$|x^2 - 4| = -(x^2 - 4) = -x^2 + 4 = 1$$. Solving for $$x$$ here yields $$x = \pm \sqrt{3}$$.
    Therefore, the solutions are $$x = \pm \sqrt{3}$$ and $$x = \pm \sqrt{5}$$.
