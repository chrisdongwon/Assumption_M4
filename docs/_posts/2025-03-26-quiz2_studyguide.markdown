On 4 April 2025 (Friday), we will have an in-class quiz. You can expect the quiz to contain five (5) problems, very similar to the following questions.

You are expected to show all work when applicable, and simplify your answers when applicable.

1. Make a truth table of the **negation operator**.
2. Make a truth table of the **conjunction operator**.
3. Make a truth table of the **disjunction operator**.
4. Make a truth table of the **implication operator**.
5. Does $$5$$ divide $$100$$? Why or why not? Does $$100$$ divide $$5$$? Why or why not?

## Suggested Solution

1. Check the booklet
2. Check the booklet
3. Check the booklet
4. You already know - check the booklet
5. $$5 \mid 100$$ because there exists an integer $$k$$ such that $$5k = 100$$. More specifically, $$k = 20$$ here. On the other hand, %100 \not \mid 5$$, because there does not exist an integer $$k$$ such that $$100k = 5$$. Well, if you solve for $$k$$, you get $$k = \frac{5}{100} = \frac{1}{20}$$, which is certainly not an integer.
