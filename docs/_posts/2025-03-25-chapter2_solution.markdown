## Section 2.1: Naive Set Theory

1. Recall that **even integers are multiples of 2**, and the numbers that are **not even are called odd integers**. In roster notation, the only possible answer here is $$\{-9, -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$$.

    With set-builder notation, we have multiple possibilities:
    - $$\{x \in \mathbb{Z} : -10 < x < 10 \text{ and } x \text{ is odd}\}$$
    - Let $$2\mathbb{Z} + 1$$ be the set of odd integers, similar to how $$2\mathbb{Z}$$ represents the multiples of 2. Then, a possible expression for the set is $$\{x \in 2\mathbb{Z}+1 : -10 < x < 10}\}$$.
    - Notice that all odds are of the form $$2x + 1$$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}$$. With $$-9 = 2(-5) + 1$$ and $$9 = 2(4)+1$$, we can say that the expression here is $$\{2x + 1 : x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } -5 \leq x \leq 4\}$$
